# Karatsuba_Algorithm


This code is a direct implementation of finding factorial of any number using Karatsuba Algorithm in Standard ML(SML).



# Usage

1) Go to directory with the code Karatsuba.sml and start cmd and type sml
2) use "Karatsuba.sml" [There will be few exhaustive warnings. Ignore those]
3) factorial("4") = "24" [Input is in string and output is also in string]
